Title: Nonlinear Regression for Agricultural Applications
Description: Additional nonlinear regression functions using self-start (SS) algorithms. One of the functions is the Beta growth function proposed by Yin et al. (2003) <doi:10.1093/aob/mcg029>. There are several other functions with breakpoints (e.g. linear-plateau, plateau-linear, exponential-plateau, plateau-exponential, quadratic-plateau, plateau-quadratic and bilinear), a non-rectangular hyperbola and a bell-shaped curve. Eighteen new self-start (SS) functions in total. This package also supports the publication 'Nonlinear regression Models and applications in agricultural research' by Archontoulis and Miguez (2015) <doi:10.2134/agronj2012.0506>, a book chapter with similar material <doi:10.2134/appliedstatistics.2016.0003> and a publication by Oddi et. al. (2019) in Ecology and Evolution <doi:10.1002/ece3.5543>. The function 'nlsLMList' uses nlsLM for fitting, but it is otherwise almost identical to 'nlme::nlsList'. One of the main benefits is that these functions can be integrated in the modeling framework of the 'nlme' package. It also provides three vignettes with extended examples.
